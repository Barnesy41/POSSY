A web-based point-of-sale (POS) and stock management system called 'POSSY'. 

Its core purpose is to provide a remote point-of-sale and stock management system to businesses, 
allowing them to open and close customers' transactions whilst automatically updating their stock management database.

The stock management database enables stock to be managed between sites whilst presenting an easy-to-read end-of-day report 
containing the total daily takings for all locations in one central hub alongside their current stock levels.
